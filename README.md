# Neonatal incubator project
Complete Arduino code with controllers, display, and Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring.

It was developed on an Arduino MEGA 2560 board, and the display used was the LCD 1602 embedded in the D1 Robot Keypad Shield for Arduino UNO.
The internet connection was achieved through an ESP32 board in combination with an MQTT broker.

A PDF report is included with complete information about the electronic incubator, schematic of the electronic circuit and hardware components, as well as the implementation of a Wi-Fi monitoring center on the ThingsBoard platform.
